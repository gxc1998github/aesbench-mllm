## About AesBench

In this work, we propose AesBench, a systematically designed golden benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the aesthetic perception abilities of MLLMs. Specifically, the proposed AesBench encompasses two major facets, i.e. highquality data and integrative criteria. In terms of the former, we construct the Expert-labeled Aesthetics Perception Database (EAPD), which consists of 2,800 diverse-sourced images covering natural images (NIs), artistic images (AIs) and artificial intelligence-generated images (AGIs). Furthermore, each image of the EAPD is annotated by experts with professional backgrounds in aesthetics, which comprises researchers engaged in computational aesthetics, educators versed in aesthetic principles, and art students possessing sophisticated art skills. With these high-quality annotations, the benchmark results of MLLMs can be more reliable. For the latter, we develop a set of integrative criteria to systematically evaluate the aesthetic perception abilities of MLLMs. These criteria are designed from four dimensions, including AesP, AesE, AesA, and AesI.
