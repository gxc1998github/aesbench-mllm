	2.	Composition:
	•	The composition follows aesthetic principles such as the rule of thirds.
	•	The subject is well-framed and positioned.
	•	The image has a balanced visual weight.
	3.	Lighting:
	•	The lighting is excellent, highlighting the subject effectively.
	•	There are no harsh shadows or overexposed areas.
	4.	Technical Quality:
	•	The image is free from noise and artefacts.
	•	The resolution is high, ensuring all details are visible.

Score 3 or 2:

	1.	Clarity and Definition:
	•	The image is clear, but may not be as sharp as High-quality images.
	•	There might be slight blur but it does not significantly affect the overall quality.
	•	It might be seemed like a low image, but it is clear and we can see in details the small objects.
